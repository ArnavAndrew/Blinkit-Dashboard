# 🛒Blinkit Sales Data Analysis Dashboard | Power BI

This project presents a comprehensive Blinkit Sales Data Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI, focusing on converting unstructured e-commerce grocery delivery data into actionable, visual insights.

🔍 Key Insights

📦 Cities like Bengaluru and Delhi NCR contribute the highest sales volumes
⏱️ Average delivery time peaks during evening slots and weekends
🥦 Fresh food and FMCG categories drive the most consistent revenue
🎯 Discount-heavy days don’t always result in profit — showing low-margin risks
♻️ Repeat customers contribute more than 60% of total revenue
📉 Certain cities show high delivery time & low satisfaction, indicating need for logistics improvements

💡 Developer Note
Modeling customer loyalty using repeat purchase logic with DAX was tricky — especially creating dynamic retention metrics over rolling time periods. Took almost 3 hours of testing!
Turns out, even formulas need loyalty to perform well 😅
